### Project Description
I downloaded a dataset from Kaggle that contains 1000 rows of sales data for a supermarket chain. I made use of a Jupyter notebook as a template, along with the pandas Python library to manipulate, clean, and format the data. After exporting the final pandas dataframe to an excel file, I linked the data to Tableau and created 3 visualizations. First, a sales line chart that plots current and previous month sales, of which the user can select the current month as a parameter in the dashboard. The second visualization is a pie chart that displays the payment methods used for sales, showing both the dollar amount of sales and percentage of monthly sales completed with each method. The third visualization displays the current and previous monthly sales by item category, along with current month gross profit for that category. There is an orange circle indicator next to each category for which the current month sales fell short of previous month sales.

One limitation I encountered came from the nature of the data itself: the gross profit percentage on each sale in the data was constant (5%), which would be incredibly unrealistic in the real world (would expect some product categories to have higher/lower markups, products on discount, etc. which would create some variation). Thus, in the third visualization displaying revenue and gross profit by category, the revenue and gross profit were perfectly correlated. Nonetheless, this did not inhibit the learning process, as this project's main objective was to develop my skills with these tools, which I believe I did successfully.
